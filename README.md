# VSD-Advanced-Physical-Design-Workshop

This file contains all the labs and Exams that were undertaken for the Advanced Physical Design Workshop conducted by VSD using OpenLane/Sky130 from 03rd Aug 2022 to 07th Aug 2022.

#Day 1 - Getting Familiar with OpenLane
Day 1 lectures mainly focused on getting started with the basics like what exactly a chip is or what is the actual difference between a chip and a package and similar stuff. Then there was a brief introduction about OpenLane Platform and it's architecture. The lab for Day 1 was getting familiar with OpenLane platform and getting to know the directory structure for the work folders provided for the workshop.

One important thing to note is the path of the folder that would be used by us is /Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane$

We start by running the docker daemon service /Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane$ docker

which should open the bash shell and look something like this.
